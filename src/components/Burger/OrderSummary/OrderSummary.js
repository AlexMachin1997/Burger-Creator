OrderSummary Notice:
- Inline styling is created, capitalizes something
- Loops through the object keys and returns a dynamic list which is then returned to print out the list
- Each li has a key which is the igKey, the inline style is applied and key is printed out to form the label
- Total price is displayed to two decimal places
- The button component is then used to produce the cancel and continue button 
    - Each button as a type to dynamcially add the styling defined in the Button component 
    - Each button also has a clicked prop, this is then passed into the BurgerBuilder where the order summary component is used
    - The buttons then referenced the modalContinueHandler and modalCancelHandler
